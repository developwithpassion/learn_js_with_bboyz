* CODING CHALLENGE 3



John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).
(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
GOOD LUCK 😀

function tipCalculator(bill) {
  //if the bill is less than 50
  // return bill * 0.20
  //if the bill is between 50 and 200
  // return bill * 0.15
  // return bill * 0.10
}

console.log(tipCalculator(124));
// 18.60

console.log(tipCalculator(48));
// 9.60

console.log(tipCalculator(268));
// 26.80
